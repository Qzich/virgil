	**Private Virgil Card**

		A Virgil Card is the main entity of the Public Keys Service, it includes the information about the user and his public key. The Virgil Card identifies the user by one of his available types, such as an email, a phone number, etc. Private Cards are created when a developer is using his own service for verification instead of Virgil Identity Service or avoids verification at all. In this case validation token is generated using appâ€™s Private Key created on our `Developer portal <https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/dashboard>`_
